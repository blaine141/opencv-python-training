OpenCV-Python Tutorials
===

## About
This repo is intended to introduce any beginner level programmer to python, numpy, and opencv. By the end of this tutorial, you should feel confident in performing basic computer vision tasks.

## Setup
Setup is fairly easy. I provide instructions to use the Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode, although you can run them any way you desire. PLEASE READ ALL THE STEPS BEFORE BEGINNING.
1. Install Python 3 and Visual Studio Code. If on Windows, make sure to check the box that says add to path.
2. Clone or download this repo
3. Open the folder containing this README in VSCode. 
4. When it prompts you about recommended extensions, hit yes. This is easy to miss.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Open [the first notebook](notebooks/0-introduction-to-python.ipynb) and begin!
